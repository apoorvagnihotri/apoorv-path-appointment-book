- The search bar on the top allows for reactive searching of "tests" and "home packages".

- In the /home page, increase the size of the buttons.
- In the / page we moved the get started button to above the image.
- In the /test pages, we colored the tests a bit differently to make them stand out than packages.
- In the /cart page, we added a user flow for adding tests, members, scheduling and payment.


Problems: 
  - Design of the add to cart button for services is not same as health packages.
  - The search bar in the home page isn't what I am expecting it to be, but it works as expected in /tests
  - The current flow of cart isn't correctly working, need to fix all the pages.
  - Login page takes a lot of time to load.
