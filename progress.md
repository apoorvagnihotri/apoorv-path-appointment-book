- The search bar on the top allows for reactive searching of "tests" and "home packages".
- Think about the icons for health packages. 
    - Full body, Fever, Heart, Vitamin, Diabetes, Thyroid, Hormones, Cancer, Lifestyle, Pregnancy, Fertility, Allergy, STD, Arthritis, Anemia
- /services page is now functional with the following services: Injection IM/IB, BP measurement, BMI calculation, ECG.
- /prescription page is now functional with the following features:
    - Add a new prescription.
    - View existing prescriptions.
- Can add health packages / services to cart.
- Why choose apoorv pathology section is more icon driven.


Problems: 
  - Design of the add to cart button for services is not same as health packages.
  - The search bar in the home page isn't what I am expecting it to be, but it works as expected in /tests
